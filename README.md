🎯 Why I Built This----------------------------------------------------------

I built Smart Study Planner to solve a common problem: managing study tasks across multiple subjects while staying aware of deadlines and overall progress.

Most basic todo apps lack:

Subject categorization

Visual progress tracking

Deadline awareness

Clean, motivating UI

This app focuses on clarity, productivity, and clean design.

✨ Features----------------------------------------------
📌 Task Management

Add new tasks

Edit existing tasks

Delete tasks

Mark tasks as complete

Set deadline for each task

Assign subject/category

Set priority (Low / Medium / High)

📊 Smart Progress Tracking----------------------------------------

Automatic completion percentage

Animated progress bar

Dashboard statistics:

Total tasks

Completed tasks

Pending tasks

⏰ Deadline Awareness------------------------------------------------

Overdue tasks automatically highlighted

Clear visual indicators

🎨 UI & UX-----------------------------------------------------

Modern SaaS-style design

Blue-purple professional theme

Smooth animations

Soft shadows & rounded cards

Clean typography

Fully responsive (mobile-friendly)

💾 Data Persistence-----------------------------------------------

Local storage support

🛠️ Tech Stack----------------------------------------------

Frontend: React / Next.js (update based on your build)

Styling: CSS / Tailwind (update if needed)

Deployment: Vercel

🧠 How It Works---------------------------------------------
